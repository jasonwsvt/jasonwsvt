- 👋 Hi, I’m Jason (@jasonwsvt).
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end and full-stack development, and determination and implementation of complex algorithms, particularly interactive web apps like board games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Django as part of a software development bootcamp through The Tech Academy.
- 💞️ Once the bootcamp is completed, I will be looking to collaborate on interesting interactive projects, possibly in environmental sustainablility, animal welfare, or civil rights.
