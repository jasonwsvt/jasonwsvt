- 👋 Hi, I’m Jason (@jasonwsvt).
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end and full-stack development, and determination and implementation of complex algorithms, particularly interactive web apps like board games.
- 🌱 Through the Tech Academy, I’ve completed a software development bootcamp, and I'm currently working on an advanced javascript bootcamp.
- 💞️ Once the bootcamp is completed, I will be looking to collaborate on interesting interactive projects, possibly in environmental sustainablility, animal welfare, or civil rights.
- 📫 You can reach me at https://www.jasonwstorer.com, https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-storer/, or https://my.indeed.com/p/jasons-gwqectw.
